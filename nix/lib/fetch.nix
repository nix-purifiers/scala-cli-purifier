# The fetcher for locked artifacts.
#
# By default each artifact is a fixed-output derivation on Nix's built-in
# fetcher (the same derivation <nix/fetchurl.nix> makes), so neither
# `scala-cli-purifier exec` nor a sandboxed build needs nixpkgs to download.
# A fixed-output store path depends only on its name and hash, so the
# default fetcher and nixpkgs' fetchurl produce the same paths.
#
# `fetchurl`, when given, replaces the built-in fetcher. It is called with
# { name, url, hash } and is the place for credentials (nixpkgs' fetchurl
# takes `netrcPhase`) or mirrors.
